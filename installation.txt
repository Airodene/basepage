Instructions for install:


Extract downloaded files into a folder. This can be called anything.
Extract the CONTENTS of the folder into your webroot. NOT the actual folder.
Follow our documentation for editing and customisation instructions!

NOTE: BasePage does not support installation into subdirectories natively. You will have to redirect your domain to the subdirectory in which BasePage is installed.
