Instructions for install:


Extract downloaded files into a folder. This can be called anything.
Extract the CONTENTS of the folder into your webroot. NOT the actual folder.
Follow our documentation and in-file comments for editing and customisation instructions!

NOTE: BasePage does not support installation into subdirectories natively. You will have to redirect your domain to the subdirectory in which BasePage is installed for it to work.

BasePage can also be installed as a page of a larger website, as long as the link points to index.php
