This is where you place any modules you either create or download. To install a module, place it into this folder, and remember the name. Then, inside "index.php" in the root, you can paste the following code to add the module:

	include 'modules/modulename.php';

Where "modulename" is the name of your module. Place this code wherever you want the module to appear.
	You can also place modules inside other modules, but you instead change the code to the following:

		include 'modulename.php'

	Again, where "modulename" is the name of the module.

This system should hopefully enable more developers to easily extend and modify BasePage's capabilities, and provide beginners with another easy way to modify their website to their liking.
